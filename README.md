# Image-Classification-NN

In this code we will be implementing some components of neural networks in numpy from scratch (all our code will be vectorized; and we don't use any library besides numpy and matplotlib). Base meta classes for the various activations, layers and optimizers are provided; all of our implementations will be classes that inherit from the appropriate base meta class.
